# SocketMC

> Minecraft Server-to-Client Direct Communication Library

## Background

"Client-side only" is a term widely used when advancing in plugin development, where you're limited in interacting with player's own client. The goal of this library
is to solve this issue: create a mod that can communicate with your plugin. That is exactly what SocketMC does! Send your own instructions to clients using our
simple and efficient API.
