# SocketMC Project Notice

This project servers as a "proof-of-concept" (POC) for a Minecraft mod that allows server-to-client communication. The mod is designed to be used in conjunction 
with a plugin that sends instructions to clients.

**The mod can be very dangerous if used incorrectly.** It can be used to send malicious instructions to clients, and can be used to exploit clients. It is important
to use this mod responsibly and only for the intended purpose. SocketMC, its authors, maintainers, and contributors are not and will not be responsible for 
any damages caused by the mod towards its users.

**All users and developers who utilize this library are responsible for their own actions.** SocketMC is provided as-is, and while there are some safeguards present
to prevent severe malicious use, it is not guaranteed to be 100% safe against all actions by malicious developers.
